Summary:
 The research paper titled "Deep Learning for Video Game Playing" by Justesen, Bontrager, Togelius, and Risi explores the application of deep learning techniques in video game playing.
The authors provide a comprehensive review of deep learning methods and game environments that have been extensively used for DL-based Game AI, such as Atari/ALE, Doom, Minecraft, StarCraft, and car racing.
They discuss various deep learning methods, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning approaches.
The authors also highlight challenges in applying deep learning techniques to video game playing, such as general game playing, dealing with extremely large decision spaces, and sparse rewards.

In reinforcement learning approaches, the authors discuss the challenge of sparse rewards in open-world games and the credit assignment problem.
They introduce various methods to tackle this problem, such as Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP), Temporal Difference (TD) learning, and Q-learning.
They also explore evolutionary approaches, like neuroevolution (NE), which can optimize network weights and topology without requiring differentiability.

The paper also focuses on game genres and research platforms relevant to deep learning, such as arcade games, real-time strategy games, and physics-based games, highlighting their characteristics and challenges for RL algorithms.

Answer:
 The main challenge discussed in the paper is the application of deep learning methods to video game playing, specifically in the context of different video game types and their unique requirements. The paper highlights several open challenges, which can be categorized into four broad areas:

1. Agent model properties: There is a need to develop more sophisticated agents that can handle a wider range of games, including those with complex rules, long-term dependencies, and sparse rewards.
2. Game industry: The paper notes that the game industry is constantly evolving, and there is a need for deep learning techniques that can adapt to new games and genres quickly.
3. Learning models of games: The paper argues that there is a need to develop more accurate and efficient models of games that can capture the complex dynamics of game playing.
4. Computational resources: Deep learning techniques for video game playing can be computationally expensive, and there is a need to develop more efficient algorithms that can run on hardware with limited resources.

The paper also discusses other challenges, such as dealing with sparse rewards, overcoming sparse, delayed, or deceptive rewards, learning with multiple agents, lifetime adaptation, human-like game playing, adjustable performance levels, and dealing with extremely large decision spaces. Additionally, the paper mentions the challenge of encouraging adoption of deep learning techniques in the game industry, where hand-authoring of expressive NPC behaviors is more commonly used.

Another challenge discussed in the paper is the lack of tools and methods for designers to easily train NPC behaviors using deep learning techniques, as most existing tools require a significant level of expertise. The paper suggests that a tool that allows designers to specify desired and undesired NPC behaviors while maintaining a certain level of control over the final trained outcomes would greatly accelerate the adoption of these new methods in the game industry.

Finally, the paper highlights the challenge of developing intelligent agents that can effectively learn and make decisions in complex, dynamic, and unstructured environments, such as text-based games and Atari games. The paper emphasizes the need for advanced reinforcement learning techniques, deep learning models, and large-scale data processing to address this challenge. The authors also discuss the importance of exploring various aspects of learning, such as exploration, communication, generalization, transfer learning, and scalability, to build more capable and versatile agents.
